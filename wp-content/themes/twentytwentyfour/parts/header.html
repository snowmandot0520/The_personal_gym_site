				Hello
				This is another project.
				This document shows how to handle repositories through the web interface as well as through the
				terminal. There are no requirements if working with the UI. If you want to work with the terminal,
				please follow these installation instructions.

				If you do not have git available as a CLI command yet, you will need to install Git for your platform.
				You will also need to install Git LFS, which will be used to handle large files such as images and model
				weights.
				Using the Hub’s web interface you can easily create repositories, add files (even large ones!), explore
				models, visualize diffs, and much more. There are three kinds of repositories on the Hub, and in this
				guide you’ll be creating a model repository for demonstration purposes. For information on creating and
				managing models, datasets, and Spaces, refer to their respective documentation.
